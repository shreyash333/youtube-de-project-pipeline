        "description": "InWhoseNameMovie.com\nX.com/InWhoseName\nInstagram.com/InWhoseName\nTikTok.com/@InWhoseNameMovie \nFacebook.com/InWhoseNameMovie\n\nThen eighteen-year-old Nicolas Ballesteros is thrust into the eye of the storm that is Ye, a man building empires in music, fashion, and faith. Coming to terms with Bipolar, his collapsing marriage, vanishing sponsorships, and growing public backlash, Ye\u2019s life unfolds alongside a billion-dollar brand and a persona as polarizing as it is powerful.\n\nFor six transformative years of 15-hour shoot days, Ballesteros did more than document a cultural icon. What began as a silent observation evolved into a profound journey of artistic and personal growth. Immersed in Ye\u2019s world of extremes, he bore witness to brilliance and breakdowns, triumphs and turmoil, but also observed the paranoia and intensity that increasingly shaped Ye\u2019s world.\n\nIn the end, Ballesteros captured not just a portrait of Ye but a reflection of the human condition in all its contradictions. The camera never blinks as Ye speaks candidly about living with bipolar disorder, offering rare insight into the realities of mental illness and its impact on identity, perception, and power. Through a personal lens, the film considers how mental health is handled - or left unspoken - among the weight of visibility and vulnerability.\nYe returns to his childhood home in Chicago, walking through its empty rooms with neighbors who knew his family when he was a boy. In these moments, stripped of fame, he reflects on his roots, his grief, and the family he longs to hold onto. Walking through Ye\u2019s inner circle, we see the loyal, the opportunistic, and the legendary; a man alternately driven by vision and consumed by ambition.\n\nIn Whose Name? invites viewers to sit with contradiction, to witness a modern myth in motion, and draw their own conclusions. The film reveals a side of Ye the world was never meant to see - raw, unfiltered, and suspended in the complexity of fame, faith, mental health, and power. The result is a story carved from 3,000 hours of raw footage, a collision of turmoil and truth, and an unflinching chronicle of ambition, collapse, and the long road to redemption.",

Now, a shocking new chapter of animatronic terror begins. \n \nOne year has passed since the supernatural nightmare at Freddy Fazbear\u2019s Pizza. The stories about what transpired there have been twisted into a campy local legend, inspiring the town\u2019s first ever Fazfest. \n \nFormer security guard Mike (Josh Hutcherson) and police officer Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail) have kept the truth from Mike\u2019s 11-year-old sister, Abby (Piper Rubio), concerning the fate of her animatronic friends. \n \nBut when Abby sneaks out to reconnect with Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, it will set into motion a terrifying series of events, revealing dark secrets about the true origin of Freddy\u2019s, and unleashing a long-forgotten horror hidden away for decades.\n \nThe cast of Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2 includes returning co-stars Theodus Crane as Jeremiah and the legendary Matthew Lillard as William Afton. The film features new characters played by Freddy Carter (Shadow and Bone, Pennyworth), Wayne Knight (Jurassic Park, Seinfeld), Mckenna Grace (Ghostbusters franchise, Annabelle Comes Home) and horror icon Skeet Ulrich (Scream, Riverdale). \n \nFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2 is directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Emma Tammi and is written by game series creator Scott Cawthon.\n \nThe film is produced by Blumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum and Scott Cawthon, who together produced the first film. The executive producers are director Emma Tammi, Beatriz Sequeira, Christopher Warner, Russell Binder and Marc Mostman. \n \nThe first Freddy\u2019s film opened to a record-shattering $80 million in October 2023 and went on to earn almost $300 million worldwide. \n\n\nSite: https://fivenightsatfreddys.movie/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FNAFMovie/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fnafmovie\nX: https://x.com/FNAFMovie\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fnafmovie?lang=en",
