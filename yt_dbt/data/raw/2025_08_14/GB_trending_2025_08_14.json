Are you sad?\nAre you always gonna hate me for that night in Tokyo? \nWhen it ended \nI kinda hoped that it\u2019d be open ended\nBut you never looked back \nWell I guess you can\u2019t hold on to something once you let it go \nBut I know a place \nWhere we can be us\nI know it ain\u2019t real \nBut it\u2019s real enough \nFrom sun going down to sun coming up \nIt\u2019s like you\u2019re here with me \nWhenever I close my eyes\nIt\u2019s taking me back in time\nBeen drowning in dreams lately \nLike it\u2019s 2019 baby \nWhenever I\u2019m missing you \nCall you up but I can\u2019t get through\nDon\u2019t know where you sleep lately \nBut I\u2019ll see you in my dreams maybe \nWe can catch up, drive down our old street\nIf all that we were is all that we\u2019ll ever be\nIt\u2019s bittersweet\nAt least a girl can dream \nI guess that I\u2019m taking what I can get \n\u2018Cause I don\u2019t get nothing new from your friends \nIf you got the harder side of the break \nThen why is it harder for me to take \nThere\u2019s so much I might never get to say, ay\nBut I know a place \nWhere we can be us\nI know it ain\u2019t real \nBut it\u2019s real enough \nFrom sun going down to sun coming up \nIt\u2019s like you\u2019re here with me \nWhenever I close my eyes\nIt\u2019s taking me back in time\nBeen drowning in dreams lately \nLike it\u2019s 2019 baby \nWhenever I\u2019m missing you \nCall you up but I can\u2019t get through\nDon\u2019t know where you sleep lately \nBut I\u2019ll see you in my dreams maybe \nWe can catch up, drive down our old street\nIf all that we were is all that we\u2019ll ever be\nIt\u2019s bittersweet\nAt least a girl can dream \nI-I-I know it\u2019s only in my mind\nPlaying three nights on the stereo\nLike a movie scene, DiCaprio \nOh l-I-I put my make up on just to fall asleep\nIt\u2019s like you\u2019re here with me \nWhenever I close my eyes\nIt\u2019s taking me back in time\nBeen drowning in dreams lately \nLike it\u2019s 2019 baby \nWhenever I\u2019m missing you \nCall you up but I can\u2019t get through\nDon\u2019t know where you sleep lately \nBut I\u2019ll see you in my dreams maybe \nWe can catch up, drive down our old street\nIf all that we were is something we\u2019ll never be\nIt\u2019s bittersweet\nCan we be friends at least\n\nCredits:\nStarring.\nLalisa Manobal\nKentaro Sakaguchi\n\nA film by ARFILM @arfilm_ojun\nWritten & Directed by OJun Kwon\n\nAssistant Director.

Are you sad?\nAre you always gonna hate me for that night in Tokyo? \nWhen it ended \nI kinda hoped that it\u2019d be open ended\nBut you never looked back \nWell I guess you can\u2019t hold on to something once you let it go \nBut I know a place \nWhere we can be us\nI know it ain\u2019t real \nBut it\u2019s real enough \nFrom sun going down to sun coming up \nIt\u2019s like you\u2019re here with me \nWhenever I close my eyes\nIt\u2019s taking me back in time\nBeen drowning in dreams lately \nLike it\u2019s 2019 baby \nWhenever I\u2019m missing you \nCall you up but I can\u2019t get through\nDon\u2019t know where you sleep lately \nBut I\u2019ll see you in my dreams maybe \nWe can catch up, drive down our old street\nIf all that we were is all that we\u2019ll ever be\nIt\u2019s bittersweet\nAt least a girl can dream \nI guess that I\u2019m taking what I can get \n\u2018Cause I don\u2019t get nothing new from your friends \nIf you got the harder side of the break \nThen why is it harder for me to take \nThere\u2019s so much I might never get to say, ay\nBut I know a place \nWhere we can be us\nI know it ain\u2019t real \nBut it\u2019s real enough \nFrom sun going down to sun coming up \nIt\u2019s like you\u2019re here with me \nWhenever I close my eyes\nIt\u2019s taking me back in time\nBeen drowning in dreams lately \nLike it\u2019s 2019 baby \nWhenever I\u2019m missing you \nCall you up but I can\u2019t get through\nDon\u2019t know where you sleep lately \nBut I\u2019ll see you in my dreams maybe \nWe can catch up, drive down our old street\nIf all that we were is all that we\u2019ll ever be\nIt\u2019s bittersweet\nAt least a girl can dream \nI-I-I know it\u2019s only in my mind\nPlaying three nights on the stereo\nLike a movie scene, DiCaprio \nOh l-I-I put my make up on just to fall asleep\nIt\u2019s like you\u2019re here with me \nWhenever I close my eyes\nIt\u2019s taking me back in time\nBeen drowning in dreams lately \nLike it\u2019s 2019 baby \nWhenever I\u2019m missing you \nCall you up but I can\u2019t get through\nDon\u2019t know where you sleep lately \nBut I\u2019ll see you in my dreams maybe \nWe can catch up, drive down our old street\nIf all that we were is something we\u2019ll never be\nIt\u2019s bittersweet\nCan we be friends at least\n\nCredits:\nStarring.\nLalisa Manobal\nKentaro Sakaguchi\n\nA film by ARFILM @arfilm_ojun\nWritten & Directed by OJun Kwon\n\nAssistant Director.

We took all the heaviest stuff we had, to create this incredibly dark, high-stress/tension song. I personally think the breakdown at the end of this is one of my favorites that we\u2019ve ever written and I\u2019m excited to see how people engage with this one.\n\nThe lyrics for this song are about my family and our history of dementia. The idea that the world is falling apart, and about the fear of losing touch with reality. \u201cThey\u2019re coming to get me\u201d is my way of personifying \u2018demons\u2019 or something that makes you feel like you\u2019re losing pieces of yourself. The closer they get, the further detached you become until you\u2019re nothing but a husk of fear and delusion.\" - WILL RAMOS\n\nLYRICS //\n\nI CAN\u2019T TELL WHERE TO GO\nI\u2019M FALLING UNTO TWILIGHT\nWHERE THE SHADOWS MEET MY SKIN\nSOMETHING HAS COME FOR MY MIND\nSLOWLY IT EATS ME INSIDE\nAND I CAN FEEL\nTHEY\u2019RE COMING TO GET ME\nI FEEL IT CLOSING IN\nTHEY\u2019RE COMING TO GET ME\nWHERE DO I GO FROM HERE NOW \nI FEEL THEIR GRIP\nCLOSING IN ON MY WILTING SOUL\nRIPPING APART ALL THE ROOTS THAT HELD ME IN CONTROL\nMAKE ME WHOLE, OR SPLIT ME IN TWO  \nDESENSITIZE MY SORROW\nREPLACE MY INSIDES\nA HOLLOW BODY VACANT OF ALL BUT FEAR\nI CAN\u2019T ESCAPE THE DARK WITHIN\nTHESE DEMONS RESIDE IN ME\n\nI AM FADING, FASTER\nSEARCHING FOR ANSWERS IN THE DARK UNTIL I DEPART\nI DRANK FROM THE RIVER\nWITHERED, LOST IN THE VOID OF MY MIND\nI\u2019VE COME TO FIND\nI\u2019M RUNNING OUT OF TIME\nTHEY\u2019RE COMING TO GET ME\nFOREVER LOST IN THE DARK\nI\u2019M RUNNING FOR MY LIFE\nLOSING PIECES OF WHAT IS LEFT OF MY SANITY\nI, EVIDENTLY, AM BECOMING EMPTY INSIDE OF THIS SHELL\nWHAT\u2019VE I BECOME\nWHERE DO I GO FROM HERE\nNOW I FEEL THEIR GRIP\nBREAKING ME DOWN\nGRASPING AT MY NECK \nPLAYING WITH MEMORIES \nALL I AM IS FUCKING SICK\nI CANNOT BREATHE INSIDE THIS HELL\nSUFFOCATE ALL REASON\nI AM NOTHING BUT BARREN\nA PRISON OF FLESH TO CONFINE THE CURSE WITHIN MY BROOD\nI CAN\u2019T ESCAPE THE DARK WITHIN\nTHESE DEMONS RESIDE IN ME\n\nI AM FADING, FASTER\nSEARCHING FOR ANSWERS IN THE DARK UNTIL I DEPART\nI DRANK FROM THE RIVER\nWITHERED, LOST IN THE VOID OF MY MIND\nI\u2019VE COME TO FIND\nI\u2019M RUNNING OUT OF TIME\nTHEY\u2019RE COMING TO GET ME\nCOMING BACK FOR ME\nBURN AWAY THE HATE\nI WILL SUFFOCATE IN THE ASHEN WAKE\nCOMING BACK FOR ME\nBURN AWAY THE HATE\nI WILL SUFFOCATE\n \nI DESCEND INTO THE VOID OF EVER GROWING NIGHT\nWHEN I\u2019M FALLING IN YOU PULL ME BACK\nI FEEL THE EVER BLACK\nFESTERING WITHIN ME\nTHEY\u2019RE COMING TO GET ME\n\n\nVIDEO CREDITS //\n\nDirector, Cinematographer, Editor, Colorist, Post-Production FX:\nDavid Brodsky for My Good Eye: Music Visuals\nwww.mygoodeyevisuals.com\n\nProducer, 1st AD, Cinematographer, Editor:\nAllison Woest for My Good Eye: Music Visuals\n\n2nd AD, Production Manager, Cinematographer:\nRobb Brown\n\nLighting Director:\nAdam Pernick\n\nBest Boy Electric:\nLindsey Fehr\n\nGrips:\nHarry Collins\nLiam DellaMonica\nSean Santiago\nMichael Tumminello\nLars Kommienezuspadt\n\nAdditional Production:\nJosh Balz\n\nLocation Management: \nConrad Bartholomew\nZak Knoll\n\nSet Design:\nGianna Chase\nZak Knoll\nDave Yezefski\n\n2D/3D/Compositing and Post SFX:\nDavid Brodsky\n\nPractical SFX:\nSiani Amelbert \nDavid Brodsky\nGianna Chase\nShinya Hamano\nKelly Harris\nZak Knoll\nPaul Mason\nShannon Mulligan\nWilliam Ventura\nDave Yezefski\n\nFeaturing:\nK.

We took all the heaviest stuff we had, to create this incredibly dark, high-stress/tension song. I personally think the breakdown at the end of this is one of my favorites that we\u2019ve ever written and I\u2019m excited to see how people engage with this one.\n\nThe lyrics for this song are about my family and our history of dementia. The idea that the world is falling apart, and about the fear of losing touch with reality. \u201cThey\u2019re coming to get me\u201d is my way of personifying \u2018demons\u2019 or something that makes you feel like you\u2019re losing pieces of yourself. The closer they get, the further detached you become until you\u2019re nothing but a husk of fear and delusion.\" - WILL RAMOS\n\nLYRICS //\n\nI CAN\u2019T TELL WHERE TO GO\nI\u2019M FALLING UNTO TWILIGHT\nWHERE THE SHADOWS MEET MY SKIN\nSOMETHING HAS COME FOR MY MIND\nSLOWLY IT EATS ME INSIDE\nAND I CAN FEEL\nTHEY\u2019RE COMING TO GET ME\nI FEEL IT CLOSING IN\nTHEY\u2019RE COMING TO GET ME\nWHERE DO I GO FROM HERE NOW \nI FEEL THEIR GRIP\nCLOSING IN ON MY WILTING SOUL\nRIPPING APART ALL THE ROOTS THAT HELD ME IN CONTROL\nMAKE ME WHOLE, OR SPLIT ME IN TWO  \nDESENSITIZE MY SORROW\nREPLACE MY INSIDES\nA HOLLOW BODY VACANT OF ALL BUT FEAR\nI CAN\u2019T ESCAPE THE DARK WITHIN\nTHESE DEMONS RESIDE IN ME\n\nI AM FADING, FASTER\nSEARCHING FOR ANSWERS IN THE DARK UNTIL I DEPART\nI DRANK FROM THE RIVER\nWITHERED, LOST IN THE VOID OF MY MIND\nI\u2019VE COME TO FIND\nI\u2019M RUNNING OUT OF TIME\nTHEY\u2019RE COMING TO GET ME\nFOREVER LOST IN THE DARK\nI\u2019M RUNNING FOR MY LIFE\nLOSING PIECES OF WHAT IS LEFT OF MY SANITY\nI, EVIDENTLY, AM BECOMING EMPTY INSIDE OF THIS SHELL\nWHAT\u2019VE I BECOME\nWHERE DO I GO FROM HERE\nNOW I FEEL THEIR GRIP\nBREAKING ME DOWN\nGRASPING AT MY NECK \nPLAYING WITH MEMORIES \nALL I AM IS FUCKING SICK\nI CANNOT BREATHE INSIDE THIS HELL\nSUFFOCATE ALL REASON\nI AM NOTHING BUT BARREN\nA PRISON OF FLESH TO CONFINE THE CURSE WITHIN MY BROOD\nI CAN\u2019T ESCAPE THE DARK WITHIN\nTHESE DEMONS RESIDE IN ME\n\nI AM FADING, FASTER\nSEARCHING FOR ANSWERS IN THE DARK UNTIL I DEPART\nI DRANK FROM THE RIVER\nWITHERED, LOST IN THE VOID OF MY MIND\nI\u2019VE COME TO FIND\nI\u2019M RUNNING OUT OF TIME\nTHEY\u2019RE COMING TO GET ME\nCOMING BACK FOR ME\nBURN AWAY THE HATE\nI WILL SUFFOCATE IN THE ASHEN WAKE\nCOMING BACK FOR ME\nBURN AWAY THE HATE\nI WILL SUFFOCATE\n \nI DESCEND INTO THE VOID OF EVER GROWING NIGHT\nWHEN I\u2019M FALLING IN YOU PULL ME BACK\nI FEEL THE EVER BLACK\nFESTERING WITHIN ME\nTHEY\u2019RE COMING TO GET ME\n\n\nVIDEO CREDITS //\n\nDirector, Cinematographer, Editor, Colorist, Post-Production FX:\nDavid Brodsky for My Good Eye: Music Visuals\nwww.mygoodeyevisuals.com\n\nProducer, 1st AD, Cinematographer, Editor:\nAllison Woest for My Good Eye: Music Visuals\n\n2nd AD, Production Manager, Cinematographer:\nRobb Brown\n\nLighting Director:\nAdam Pernick\n\nBest Boy Electric:\nLindsey Fehr\n\nGrips:\nHarry Collins\nLiam DellaMonica\nSean Santiago\nMichael Tumminello\nLars Kommienezuspadt\n\nAdditional Production:\nJosh Balz\n\nLocation Management: \nConrad Bartholomew\nZak Knoll\n\nSet Design:\nGianna Chase\nZak Knoll\nDave Yezefski\n\n2D/3D/Compositing and Post SFX:\nDavid Brodsky\n\nPractical SFX:\nSiani Amelbert \nDavid Brodsky\nGianna Chase\nShinya Hamano\nKelly Harris\nZak Knoll\nPaul Mason\nShannon Mulligan\nWilliam Ventura\nDave Yezefski\n\nFeaturing:\nK.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

Some of you may have also seen me die at the end of the last video\u2026but we transferred my mind into a robot. So its all good. I will also explain this in our episode 3 breakdown as I dunno how many people are gonna watch this. But i\u2019m fine. I am the same person.\n\nPlay full teaser\n\nAnyway the teaser begins with what looks like the basement level of the building in New Siam. We see Wendy dropping down and she\u2019s likely looking for her brother. Episode 2 ended with her leaving slightly and being slightly worried about him being grabbed by the xenomorph. My guess is shes gonna go looking for it. We\u2019ve often seen how the creatures grab someone and take them away which was something we got with Newt. So my guess is he\u2019ll be stuck up to the wall and she\u2019ll have to fight to get him freed.\n\nAt the end we see a lung in capsule and I do wonder if this is her infected brothers. I know from personal experience that the xenomorphs grab you, stick you up and then put an egg in front of you. So I do wonder if that\u2019s whats gonna happen as we know the gang get taken out to Neverland. Theyve got state of the art facilities and possibly removed it before it got too big.\n\nAnyway we then cut to the title and hear the.",
